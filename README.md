# History Survival
Conqueror of Empires is a turn-based strategy game where up to 4 local players battle to be victorious, by expanding their empires, and controlling units to conquer cities and attack the enemy.

The game was inspired by [Conqueror-of-Empires](https://github.com/Ben-Ryder/Conqueror-of-Empires/), [Polytopia](http://midjiwan.com/polytopia.html) and [Civilisation](https://civilization.com/) and made using python and pygame.  
To download executables see [releases](https://github.com/https://github.com/Sam-Machines/HistorySurvival/releases).
